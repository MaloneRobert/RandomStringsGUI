# RandomStringsGUI

Basic Java Code: 
  I wrote this code while I was in Spain over the summer of 2017 for my study abroad program. I wanted to learn more about graphics, 
  so I drove into Graphics and Graphics2D in Java. This is one of the early programs I created as a stepping stone to understanding 
  how graphics work. It is a good example of how to use a MouseListener, and paint a component onto the screen.
